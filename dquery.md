# :tada: Introduction

http://d-portal.org/dquery/

dQuery lets you query **the complete IATI data, including non-standard attributes and extensions** directly into the live d-portal database, in a modern browser.

```diff
+ Documentation is ongoing so please bear with us.
```
dQuery works well if you are familiar with the IATI Standard elements and querying in SQL using JSONB data types in PostgreSQL. However, it shouldn't be too hard to pick up once you've done a few recipes.

## Tool

The current interface is sparse and consists of two panels; the editor on the left and the console on the right.  
There are four buttons above these panels which perform various things.

**Examples**  
Some example recipes.

**Run Query**  
View results in the browser.  
*If queries are complex, this can slow down the browser.*  

**Browse Activities**  
View results in d-portal.

**Download XSON**  
Download data in various formats without viewing results in the browser.

You can drag the partition to increase or decrease the space of either panel.  

## Data formats

Downloads of data is available as csv, json, xml and html.

The html option will only work at the top level of an activity or an organisation file; ie. when ```select *```, the root needs to be at either ```/iati-activities/iati-activity``` or ```/iati-organisations/iati-organisation```.

The html option is a Print-friendly version of SAVi (Simple Activity Viewer).

Replace ```/#``` in the url with ```?form=csv&sql=``` to get the query link in different formats.  

## Commands

You can more or less figure out what a query does by reading it like a sentence.  
The following table lists the most common SQL clauses and operators you can use to create queries.

| Commands | What it does |
| --- | ----------- |
| select | Picks fields that contain data of interest |
| from | For dQuery, this is usually ```xson``` |
| where | Limits the data set we are working with |
| and | Additional limits |
| or | Additional limits |
| not | Additional limits |
| like | Use this with ```%``` for wildcard queries |
| as | Use this to name columns |
| in | Allows you to specify multiple values |
| group by | Aggregates values across row |
| order by | Specifies sorting of results with option for ```asc``` or ```desc``` |
| limit | Limits the number of returned results |
| offset | Skips a given number of results |
| join | Get data from 2 or more tables |

## Select

The following table lists the most common commands using select.

| Commands | What it does |
| --- | ----------- |
| `*` | Returns full acitivity information, in their original order |
| count(`*`) | Returns a number of items |
| distinct aid | Returns a list of unique identifiers |
| aid | Returns a list of identifiers |
| pid | Returns a list of publishers |

#### Examples
```sql
select distinct aid 
```
```sql
select pid
```
```sql
select * 
```

# :sparkles: Recipes

The following recipes are some examples of what you can query using this tool.

Some of these are requests for when more complex data is needed outside the scope of the d-portal platform.  
Where applicable, results are limited to 1 in the examples below.

Add comments like so
```sql
-- This is a comment

/*
This is a  
multi line comment
*/
```

## Displays a count of certain element or attributes
```sql
select

count(*)

from xson where root='/iati-organisations/iati-organisation'
and xson->>'/total-budget' IS NOT NULL

```

Result

```sql
{
    result: [
        {
            count: "437"
        }
    ],
    duration: 0.053
}
```

## Displays all ```iati-identifier``` with that search term using a wildcard ```%```
Raised https://github.com/codeforIATI/iati-ideas/issues/37

The wildcard ```%``` can be placed before, after or before and after a search term to get the following results.

```%<searchterm>``` looks for identifiers that end with the search term.  
```<searchterm>%``` looks for identifiers that start with the search term.  
```%<searchterm>%``` looks for identifiers that has the search term within it.
	
```sql
select

distinct aid

from xson where root='/iati-activities/iati-activity' 
and xson->>'/iati-identifier' like '%1022474%'

limit 1;
```

Result

```sql
{
    result: [
        {
            aid: "1022474"
        },
        {
            aid: "DE-1-201022474"

```

## Display an element attribute, grouped in descending order
Use ```as``` to name the columns  
Order always depend on the column number or names, 3 being the count  
You can use multiple groups, as you would a table grouping columns

```sql
select

xson->>'@ref' as old_id, pid as new_id, count(*)

from xson where root='/iati-activities/iati-activity/other-identifier' and xson->>'@type' = 'B1'

            count: "279337"
        },
    ],
    duration: 2.415
}
```

## Display information within an element
https://github.com/devinit/D-Portal/issues/620

Show all information within ```/budget``` for multiple identifiers.
This works for ```/budget``` as ```root``` because this array occurs only once.

```sql
select *

from xson where root='/iati-activities/iati-activity/budget'
and aid in ('BE-10-3011287','BE-10-3011636','BE-10-3012116',

        }
    ],
    duration: 0.007
}
```

## Display identifier only sorted by the second array (narrative) in descending order
You can order by ```aid``` and ```descending``` as well.

```sql
select

aid , JSONB_ARRAY_LENGTH(xson->'/narrative')

from xson where JSONB_ARRAY_LENGTH(xson->'/narrative') is not null

order by 2 desc
limit 1;

Result

```sql

```


## Display number of items and include all activities information for certain element and vocab
```sql
select

JSONB_ARRAY_LENGTH(xson->'/narrative') , *

from xson where root='/iati-activities/iati-activity/sector' and xson->>'@vocabulary' = '99' and JSONB_ARRAY_LENGTH(xson->'/narrative') > 1

order by 1 desc

limit 1;
```

Result

```sql

            pid: "XM-DAC-301-2",
            root: "/iati-activities/iati-activity/sector",
            xson: {
                @code: "4",
                /narrative: [
                    {
                        : "Stimulating sustainable economic growth",
                        @xml:lang: "EN"
                    },

## Display all activity identifiers with element attribute of certain value

AND
    xson->>'@code' = 'EP-2020-000012-001'
limit 1;
```

Result

```sql
